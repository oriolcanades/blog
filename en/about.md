I'm Oriol Canadés, and I'm passionate about finding the balance between technical efficiency and strategic clarity, helping teams design robust and sustainable solutions.

My approach blends technical rigor, curiosity, and adaptability, ensuring that technology solves real problems and delivers true value.

### Experience & Background

I have worked on client projects as well as with innovative technologies like **verifiable credentials**, combining software architecture with technical leadership.

My experience has made me a bridge between development and business teams, helping transform needs into scalable solutions.

Currently, I work at IN2 on projects related to verifiable credentials, and I actively participate in the **Digital Credentials Protocols Working Group** of the *OpenID Foundation* and the **Identity Committee** at *Alastria*. These communities allow me to contribute to the development of global standards while staying close to real-world implementations.

### What I Bring

I combine hands-on technical experience with leadership skills to help teams deliver robust, efficient, and future-proof systems. I'm especially interested in initiatives where identity technologies play a key role in enabling secure, trustworthy interactions between people and systems.

### Let’s Connect

I'm always open to sharing knowledge, exchanging ideas, and collaborating on projects where technology becomes a lever for impact.
