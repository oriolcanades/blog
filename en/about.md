# About me

I'm **Oriol Canad√©s**, passionate about finding the balance between technical efficiency and strategic clarity, helping teams design robust and sustainable solutions.

My approach combines technical rigor, curiosity, and adaptability, ensuring that technology solves real problems and delivers real value.

## Experience and journey

I have worked on both client projects and innovative technologies such as **verifiable credentials**, blending software architecture with technical leadership.

My experience has positioned me as a bridge between development teams and business needs, helping transform requirements into scalable solutions.

Currently, I work at **IN2** on projects related to verifiable credentials, and I actively participate in the **Digital Credentials Protocols Working Group** of the *OpenID Foundation* and in the **Identity Committee** of *Alastria*.  
These spaces allow me to contribute to the development of global standards without losing touch with practical implementation.

## What I bring

I combine hands-on technical experience with leadership skills to help teams build robust, efficient, and future-ready systems.  
I am especially interested in initiatives where identity technologies are key to enabling secure and trusted interactions between people and systems.

## Let's connect

I'm always open to sharing knowledge, exchanging ideas, and collaborating on projects where technology becomes a true driver of impact.
