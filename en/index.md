<h3>Welcome to my blog!</h3>

Here I share what I learn about software architecture, development, and technical leadership.  
I explore best practices, design patterns, and the real challenges we face in the day-to-day tech world.

My goal is to spark conversations and share insights that help others improve their work and make better decisions.  
If anything you read here resonates with you, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts.
