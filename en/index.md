## Architecture, decisions and conversations that matter

I design digital solutions with a strategic and human-centered perspective.

This blog is where I share lessons and ideas around <a href="/en/digital-identity/">Digital Identity</a>,
<a href="/en/software-architecture/">Software Architecture</a>,
<a href="/en/java-spring/">Java and Spring development</a> and <a href="/en/leadership/">Technical Leadership</a>.  
You wonâ€™t find universal solutions here â€” just honest reflections, 
useful failures and insights from real-world experience.

If something resonates with you, Iâ€™d love to connect.
